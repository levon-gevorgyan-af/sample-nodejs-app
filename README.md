## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application Locally
To start the application, you need to set the PORT environment variable.
```bash
# linux bash
PORT=3000 npm start
```

```bash
# windows cmd
set PORT=3000 && npm start
```

This will start the server, and the application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

### Running the Tests

```bash
# linux bash
